# Advent of Code 2022
### Version 6.0.0

Thanks (@GV14982)(https://github.com/GV14982) for reminding me I need to add a README...

Here are my solutions for the Advent of Code (2022). I opted to use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as I already use it, and am too lazy to learn a new language right now (unlike Graham!... RESPECT).

My code is probably going to be bad at first. But, because I'm a nerd, I will likely refactor it **CONSTANTLY**. I'll be the only dev out there running a AOC2022 repository at version 198.10.3 by the time January rolls around.

Please remember to STAR everyone's Advent of Code repos as you find them, it's more fun to share the love.

Merry Christmas everyone, and stay classy!\
-Sean

## Setup Notes
I built this using Node.JS / Typescript / Yarn. Chances are you already know how to get your environment up and running. If not, I suggest checking out the following site:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)

## Getting Running

1) **Install NPM and Yarn**
   
2) **Install dependencies**\
   `yarn install`\

3) **Build & Run**\
   `yarn prod`

## Yarn Scripts

- **`yarn prod`**\
  Builds and executes the Advent of Code 2022 codebase

- **`yarn build`**\
  Just builds the code.

- **`yarn start`**\
  Execute codebase after it's been built

- **`yarn clean`**\
  Cleans up codebase using Prettier

- **`yarn lint`**\
  Runs ESLint and displays errors and warnings for you to fix.

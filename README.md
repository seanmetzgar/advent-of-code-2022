# Advent of Code 2022

Thanks @GV14982 for reminding me I need to add a README...

Here are my solutions for the Advent of Code (2022). I opted to use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as I already use it, and am too lazy to learn a new language right now (unlike Graham!... RESPECT).

My code is probably going to be bad at first. But, because I'm a nerd, I will likely refactor it **CONSTANTLY**. I'll be the only dev out there running a AOC2022 repository at version 198.10.3 by the time January rolls around.

Please remember to STAR everyone's Advent of Code repos as you find them, it's more fun to share the love.

Merry Christmas everyone, and stay classy!
